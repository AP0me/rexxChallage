Szenario:
Imagine an external event booking system exports a simple plain json export file of the newest bookings.
This data should be presented in our system.

What you need to do?:
- Design a database scheme for optimized storage
- Please note that over time, large amounts of data will accumulate
- Read the json data and save it to the database using php
- Create a simple page with filters for the employee name, event name and date
- Output the filtered results in a table below the filters
- Add a last row for the total price of all filtered entries

Environment:
PHP 7, MySQL / MariaDB

This code challenge shouldn't take more than 90 minutes.
KISS - Keep it simple stupid performant and secure!

Please code in plain PHP, no Framework allowed!

When you are done, satisfied and proud of your work,
please wrap the git repository including all commits in a ZIP file
and send it to us within the next 4 days.
